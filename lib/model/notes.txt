in model it has
logic
data holder
defines rules 
we write in class 

eg
class Product {
    string ProductImage;
    string ProductName;
    double Price;
    bool isFavourate
    bool inCart
}


why state management is used : provider  ?
you requre users id and tokens 
if you use setstate while building the users profile 
it will run but the data will not be transferted into the other pages
so use state management provider
set state is used to display the things rather than data transfer

how does the provider work?
